                Shinchan is inspired by the real life kid “Shinnosuke Nohara” who faced death in a car accident. His mother “Misae” went in misery and gloom after the son’s death, Misae started sketching Shinchan in his remembrance. She described him frequently, his fun days and all her flash of memory were creatively portrayed in the bundles of sketches she drew. Later, a cartoonist Yoshita Usai gazed at those beautiful drawings and offered to develop these memories into a Japanese magazine daily, which then gained immense ratings and popularity. Shinchan was translated into diverse language and started selling worldwide. The crayons of her mother embraced the emergence of the cartoon series “Crayon Shinchan.”
